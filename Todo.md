## Notes for TestCases

2. Test detects failures for non-valid input data
3. Corner-Cases: test ranges, some values should be postive
   ex: if we ask system for critical amount of data -
   system should allow only configured values
4. Create Test on Interfaces
5. Create Test that detects all retunred data is valid, not only presence
   ( it allows detecting conversion cases between subsystems, aka diff timezones in client and server and not correctly handling it)
